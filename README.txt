Hi, this is VegaPac.
You can use this code however you want, it's free. I am not affiliated with the original Minesweeper creator this is
just a mere reinterpretation of the undying legenary Minesweeper. To code this I use Python mainly with the Tkinter module.
I also had to use Threading to keep track of the time score and time obviusly to count the seconds. 
The main.py file contains the game while func.py contains the classes on which the game runs on.
To run the game YOU HAVE TO RUN main.py.
I created two main classes, Menu and Cells. Menu open and run the other class, Cells, that contains most of the code.
THERE ARE ALMOST NO COMMENTS SO GOOD LUCK xDDDD
